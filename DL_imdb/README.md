# DeepLearning_MovieReviews
My first DL code following the book "Deep Learning with Python and Keras" written by Keras developer Francois Chollet

The source code is basically just copied from a tutorial, with some slight changes I made to play around with it.

In this example we extract data in form of textual film reviews provided by imdb (Internet movie database) and try to classify them in either a good or a bad review (binary classification).

The comments in the code have been added by myself in the process of comprehending it.

Also originally the code was implemented with functionally programming.

I implemented the object orientation to seperate the training of the model from its deployment.

Although I didn't write the programm myself, it really gave me a good first understanding of how preparing and implementing a deep learning model looks like resp. how the mechanisms work and which effect different adjustments have on the outcome.
