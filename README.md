In this repository I will upload files I coded from the book "Deep Learning with python and keras" by keras developer Francois Chollet.

As I am writing this, I did not write any of the codes completely by myself and instead just followed the tutorials given by the book.

I still added some little details though, like the object orientation or the modulization of reoccuring functions.

Each directory contains the files for a single project in which a certain problem is tackled.

The numbers at the end of the directory names indicate the order in which they occur in the book resp. in which I coded them.

I will keep following the tutorials until I got in contact with all the most common classification problems, but at the moment I feel really comfortable to be able
to write the code for a little project myself (admittedly not very hard with such a powerful framework as keras) and will use the time to come up with an idea for a good classification problem than can be solved by a simple Deep Learning code.

Until then I will keep uploading the tutorials and will try to add a little twist here and there.
